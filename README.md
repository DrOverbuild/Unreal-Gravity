Unreal Gravity (Formerly "Falling Up") is an upcoming 2D endless arcade game with unique mechanics and a new entertaining cartoon look.

Tap the screen and the character will flip and fall in the opposite direction. Avoid the boxes, or you will trip and fall. Or intentionally hit the boxes to see how far they can fly. It's up to you!
